### Introduction: The Data Challenge
Hello and welcome to my Week 13 Internship Publication at DataraFlow! As a firm focused on data-driven solutions, our internship requires us to constantly translate theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world results.

The primary objective for Week 13 was a focused application of a core data skill: Web Scraping. Specifically, the assignment was to replicate a structured data extraction and analysis process demonstrated in a previous learning module. This wasn't just about following steps; it was about solidifying my understanding of how we can reliably source data when formal APIs aren't available.

### Background: The Power of Programmatic Web Scraping
Before diving into the code, it's essential to understand why we rely on web scraping.

#### What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the automated process of extracting large amounts of data from websites. While companies prefer to use official Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for data, many valuable public resources are only available in a human-readable (HTML) format. Scraping allows us to programmatically read and structure contents.

Web scraping is particularly useful when:
- Data is publicly available but not downloadable
- APIs are unavailable or limited
- Real-time or frequently updated data is required

Key components of web scraping include:
- Sending HTTP requests to web pages
- Parsing HTML content
- Identifying and extracting relevant elements (tables, text, links)
- Cleaning and structuring the extracted data

#### Tools and Technologies Introduced
During this week, I was introduced to practical tools commonly used for web scraping and data handling, including:
- Python – for scripting and automation
- Requests – for fetching web page content
- BeautifulSoup – for parsing and navigating HTML structures
- Pandas – for cleaning, structuring, and exporting scraped data

These tools collectively enable efficient extraction and transformation of web-based data.
